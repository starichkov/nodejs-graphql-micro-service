# Node.js GraphQL Micro-service Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the **Computer Parts Shop** micro-service showcase.

This project is designed as an educational resource to demonstrate a professional, standard way of implementing a micro-service using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Goal of this Project

The primary goal is to provide a "gold standard" example for developers who want to learn how to:
- Build a robust GraphQL API with [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/).
- Interface with MongoDB using [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/).
- Containerize a micro-service with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- Implement a comprehensive testing strategy using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Testcontainers for Node.js](https://node.testcontainers.org/).
- Set up a professional CI/CD pipeline with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Navigation

This manual is divided into several sections to help you understand different aspects of the service:

- [**Architecture**](architecture.md): Learn about the project structure and the design patterns used.
- [**API Guide**](api-guide.md): Details about the GraphQL schema, queries, and mutations.
- [**Database**](database.md): How we model data and interact with MongoDB.
- [**Testing**](testing.md): Deep dive into our unit and integration testing strategy.
- [**CI/CD**](ci-cd.md): Explanation of our automated build, test, and coverage reporting pipeline.

## Quick Start
